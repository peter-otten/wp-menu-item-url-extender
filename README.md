Extends menu items with the corresponding url. This is helpfull if you have multiple sections in your website that have the same pages. For example: I maintain a tech site for Javascript and PHP and they both have a Contact page. The menu will show two pages Contact with no difference. This plugin will extend the menu item with the corresponding url.<br />The items will show up like this:

Contact<br />
example.com/Javascript/contact

Contact<br />
example.com/PHP/contact
